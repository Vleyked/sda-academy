The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

This is a dataset containing 60,000 small square 28 × 28 pixel grayscale images made up of handwritten single digits from 0 to 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values ​​from 0 to 9 inclusive.

It is a commonly used and deeply understood dataset that has been mostly "resolved". The models with the highest performance are deep 
learning convolutional neural networks that achieve classification accuracy above 99%. The error rate in such cases are set between 
0.4% and 0.2% for the test dataset.


By using conventional methods, create a pipeline that extracts features from the image. Next, try to solve the task.

1 - Load the image base into memory.
2 - Display a few sample images for an introduction to MNIST.
3 - Create a function that retrieves information about the appropriate contour from the image.
4 - Create a function that gets the features from the contour.
5 - Present the data in the form of dataframes (don't forget - do this both for the test and the training images).
6 - Normalize the data!
7 - Classification! Report the results.

Bonus:  code uses the imgaug library to apply an affine rotation to a list of images. The library is imported as "iaa" and a random seed of 4 is set for reproducibility. The list of images is named "images" and is created with four instances of the same image.
A variable "rotate" is defined as an affine rotation with a range of -25 to 25 degrees. The rotate variable is then applied to the images using the "rotate()" function, creating the augmented images in "image_aug". The augmented images are then printed and displayed using the imshow() function from the imgaug library.
